fluid overload there is bibasilar atelectasis with a small focus of consolidation in the right lower lobe 2 35 unchanged from 2141 10 13 and may reflect aspiration or pneumonia scattered bilateral nodules are largely stable from as far back as 2139 10 9 specifically there is a 5 mm nodule in the right middle lobe 2 25 two adjacent nodules in the right lower lobe measuring 5 mm and 2 mm 2 24 and a 4 mm pleural based nodule within the left lower lobe a nodular density seen adjacent and anterior to the right main pulmonary artery 2 23 may reflect a vessel there is a small right pleural effusion axillary lymphadenopathy with axillary nodes measuring up to approximately 10 mm in short axis is seen ill defined soft tissue thickening within the hilus bilaterally may reflect hilar lymphadenopathy but assessment is limited without iv contrast a catheter is visualized within the visualized right upper extremity which may reflect a picc line that terminates within the right subclavian vein the esophagus is distended and filled with contrast with marked wall thickening and edema throughout its entire length a new finding there is a moderate sized hiatal hernia ct of the abdomen without iv contrast there has been interval development of a moderate amount of free intraperitoneal air that layers anteriorly and along the anterior abdominal wall additional small clustered foci of extraluminal air is seen adjacent to the proximal stomach and the gastroesophageal junction with a focus of air tracking into the fissure of ligamentum venosum additionally there appears to be air tracking into the anterior subcutaneous tissues in the region of the umbilicus these findings are all new from the prior ct on 2141 10 13 but free air was present on chest radiograph performed 2141 10 25 there is no obvious evidence of extravasation of oral contrast into the peritoneum of note a peritoneal dialysis catheter is in place that could represent a route of entry of intraperitoneal air the stomach small bowel and colon are filled with contrast without evidence of obstruction evaluation for wall thickening is limited without iv contrast limited non contrast views of the liver demonstrates a rounded 1 6 cm x 1 2 cm hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver previously characterized as a hemangioma the liver is otherwise unremarkable the gallbladder spleen pancreas and adrenal glands demonstrate no gross abnormality both kidneys are atrophic evaluation of solid organs is limited by lack of iv contrast there is a peritoneal dialysis catheter coiled within the pelvis unchanged there is a large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen similar in appearance to the prior study ct of the pelvis without iv contrast uterus and rectum are grossly unremarkable however assessment of the rectal wall is limited without iv contrast osseous structures bones are diffusely sclerotic which may be related to renal osteodystrophy there is bilateral sacroiliitis impression 1 interval development of a moderate amount of free intraperitoneal air new from 2141 10 13 a peritoneal dialysis catheter is in place and could represent the route of entry of free intraperitoneal air however as foci of air is seen in the region of the proximal stomach and ge junction in the setting of a recent endoscopy perforation cannot be excluded though no frank extravasation of contrast is identified 2 new dilation and wall thickening of the entire esophagus a nonspecific finding that could relate to infectious or inflammatory esophagitis clinical correlation is recommended esophagus is contrast filled possibly representing reflux hiatal hernia 3 anasarca with moderate sized pericardial effusion pulmonary edema and small right pleural effusion 4 large amount of free intra abdominal fluid in the setting of peritoneal dialysis imaging cannot exclude sbp which should be evaluated for clinically 5 focus of consolidation within the right lower lobe could represent aspiration or

secondary to sle started peritoneal dialysis approximately one week prior to admission malignant htn h o svc syndrome and multiple thrombotic events on warfarin who is presenting with persistent suprapubic lower abdominal pain and new onset severe epigastric pain w nausea and vomiting and hypertension her hospital course was complicated by multiple transfers between the micu and the floor secondary to hypertensive urgency abdominal pain diarrhea during the patient s admission her complaints of abdominal pain nausea diarrhea and vomiting progressively improved although no clear source of the symptoms was found infectious causes including viral gastroenteritis peritonitis or c dif colitis were considered however during the initial part of her admission the patient remained afebrile with an initial relative leukocytosis which trended to within baseline limits the patient was empirically placed on iv flagyl but this was discontinued when stool samples were negative for c difficile serial abdominal exams showed no peritoneal signs peritoneal dialysis fluid analysis was negative for leukocytosis without organisms on gram stain ct of the abdomen on 10 13 showed evidence of multifocal small bowel thickening and gastric wall edema but no acute process other etiologies of her abdomoinal pain were also considered including mesenteric ischemia bowel secondary to sle vasculitis malignant htn or microthrombosis and sle enteritis surgery was consulted and felt that the patient did not have an ischemic bowel as serial lactates were negative and serial abdominal exams showed improvement in pain a heparin drip and warfarin were started for treatment of possible microthrombotic ischemia although this was stopped when the patient had evidence of a possible gi bleed with regards to sle vasculitis enteritis rheumatology was consulted and they did not believe her symptoms were related to sle on 10 18 gi performed an egd which showed erosion in the gastroesophageal junction yet an otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to third part of the duodenum biopsies of stomach antrum and proximal jejunum were negative approximately halfway through her hospital course the patient complained of severe epigastric pain in addition to her lower abdominal pain both cardiac gi and pulmonary etiologies were considered for the origin of her epigastric pain pericarditis was considered but her ekg was unchanged from prior studies and there had been on interval increase in her pericardial effusion since 2141 10 13 her lungs were also essentially unchanged from 2141 10 13 however her abdominal ct on 2141 10 26 showed a large amount of free intra abdominal fluid in the setting of peritoneal dialysis as a result the patient underwent an exploaratory laparotomy on 2141 10 27 there were no major findings no evidence of perforation obstruction or infection the patient tolerated the procedure well and immediately reported that both her epigastric and suprapubic pain were gone after the surgery at discharge the patient only complained of some mild incisional pain hypertensive urgency the patient was initially admitted to the micu with a blood pressure of 240 180 her hospital course was complicated by extremely labile htn and was transferred back and forth between the micu and the floor on three separate occasions 10 19 10 21 and 10 22 for identical episodes of sbps 260 throughout all of these episodes of hypertensive urgency the patient remained asymptomatic from a neuro and cardiac standpoint except for occasional headache her final transfer to the floor occured 2141 10 25 where she remained for the rest of her hospital course multiple medication regimens were attempted and changed throughout her hospital course however her blood pressures finally stabilized when she was placed back on her oral home regimen which includes nifedipine clonidine patch labetalol aliskiren and hydralazine with a hydralazine sliding scale for sbps 180 at discharge the only change from her home regimen that was made was increasing her nifedipine to 90 mg po her regimen as per dr last name stitle 4883 nifedipine sr 90 mg daily aliskiren 150 mg hospital1 labetalol

her baseline of 8 9 during her admission the patient underwent multiple trials of peritoneal dialysis but was unable to tolerate it on a consistent basis secondary to abdominal pain prior to her exploratory laparotomy she was scheduled to have peritoneal dialysis four times per day over 4hrs with 2 solution at 1 2l per pd after her exploratory laparotomy surgery strongly advised the medical team that she should not restart peritoneal dialysis until she was at least 3 weeks out from her surgery initially the patient adamantly refused hemodialysis however over several days she became hyperkalemic and increased swelling was noted bilaterally in her ankles and feet as a result after a long coversation with her primary renal physician name10 nameis agreed to restart hemodialysis a tunneled catheter was placed in her r femoral vein on 2141 11 1 and she subsequently started hemodialysis the same day which she tolerated well she underwent hemodialysis two more times prior to discharge upon discharge her electrolytes were back to her baseline she is expected to undergo hemodialysis tues last name un sat as an outpatient anemia during her admission the patient s hct was monitored daily with hct to low mid 20 s on 2141 10 17 she was found to have guaiac positive stools and her hct was found to have dropped to a low of 18 6 the patient was transfused a total of 2 units of date range between 2141 10 17 and 2141 10 18 epo alfa sc was also given on 2141 10 17 she remained hemodynamically stable gi consulted and egd results were as stated above the patient s hct remained stable hovering between 25 27 from 2141 10 19 2141 10 23 between 2141 10 23 2141 10 24 the patient had a hct drop from 26 to 20 in the setting of occult positive emesis she received two units of month day year and her hct returned to 28 gi was aware and planned to perform a non urgent egd on 10 25 or 10 26 as the patient was hemodynamically stable and her hct returned to baseline however this did not occur as the patient went for an exploratory laparotomy on 2141 10 27 and her hct remained stable and near baseline for the remiainder of her hospital course h o thrombosis the patient was initially placed on her home dose of warfarin 2mg qd her inr on admission was 1 2 she was also started heparin drip secondary to concern for ischemic bowel 2 11 microthrombotic disease however this was stopped for her egd and after she had evidence of a gi bleed the heparin drip was discontinued on 10 22 the patient remained off heparin and coumadin from 2141 10 23 2141 10 25 given her drop in hct and in preparation for a possible gi intervention after her surgery her coumadin was held and she was off the heparin drip but her inr continued to drift up getting as high as 2 6 on 2141 10 30 this was mostly attributed to nutritional deficiency 2 11 poor po intake but there was concern for possible synthetic dysfunction as well as a result she was given a test dose of vitamin k which she responded to well her inr came back down to 1 4 as a result her home dose of coumadin at 2 mg qday was restarted at discharge her inr was still sub therapeutic at 1 4 of note the patient has a history of svc syndrome and had a l subclavian venous thrombosis during the last few days of her hospital stay the patient complained of increased tongue swelling and her l face was noted to be slightly more swollen than previously noted as a result she underwent upper extremity venous ultrasound on 2141 11 2 which showed no evidence of a dvt within the left upper extremity and the previously noted thrombus within the left subclavian vein was not seen as well sle rheumatology was consulted several times throughout her hospital course but they did not think that a lupus flare was contributing to her presentation her outside rheumatologist was also consulted both parties wanted to keep the patient on her home dose of prednisone of 4 mg qday which was continued throughout her entire hospital course obstructive sleep apnea the patient was noted to have osa based on clinical nocturnal exam during admission patient attempted 1 trial of cpap at 2l min for 1 2 hrs with nasal mask however did not tolerate as she complained of claustrophobia the paitent stated that she would pursue further work up and treatment for osa as an outpatient while the mask and cpap machine were at her bedside

other home medications at the advice of renal the patient was transferred to the floor on 12 10 after resolution of her hypertensive urgency with a decreased blood pressure regimen due to her hypotension in response to home doses of her medications on 12 11 the patient s sbp dropped to the 80 s and due to her pain medications she was extremely lethargic but arousable a picc line was placed because lack of access and she was bolused 250cc ns the patient s pressures responded and additional narcotics were held due to her mental status the patient s blood pressures continued to be labile and her clonidine patch was increased to 0 3mg 24hr and her hydralazine was titrated back to 100mg daily the patient did require iv hydralazine prn for control of her blood pressures initially but was

control and a simplified regimen as there was concern for patient compliance titration of these medications on the medical floor and addition of hydralazine did not result in adequate bp control as the patient had several systolic blood pressure readings in the 250s she was then transferred to the intensive care unit for uncontrolled bp accompanied by head ache once there she received iv antihypertensives and hd was initiated several lbs were taken off facilitating bp control with oral medications she was transferred back to the medical floor and stabilized on a regimen of clonidine patch qweek tid labetolol and qd lisinopril rheum ms known lastname has sle with discoid rash and arf she was started on a prednisone burst with calcium supplementation she was also started on plaquanil for 1 2 months for her discoid rash she will be followed by dr last name stitle in clinic who will arrange for her to see an ophthalmologist of note her complement levels were low her ds dna was positive and her anti cardiolipin igg and igm were within normal limits renal ms known lastname presented with acute on chronic renal insufficiency her rise in creatinine was dramatic from baseline of 1 2 in month only 958 to 5 2 at presentation this was thought to be multifactorial from both htn and an exacerbation of sle her ace inhibitor was initially held and her creatinine continued to worsen of note her ua remained somewhat bland without acanthocytes her blood pressure remained difficult to control requiring another trip to the micu for administration of iv antihypertensives it was decided that some of this was attributed to volume overload so hd was initiated a tunnel line was placed and the patient tolerated the procedure and the hd well it was thought that the hd would be temporary but that the patient would eventually progress to esrd in the near future she was also started on mycophenolate mofetil in the hopes of slowing her progression to esrd and giving her a few months before having to start hd as more permanent renal replacement she was discharged with instructions to come for hd mondays wednesdays and fridays heme ms known lastname presented with arf thrombocytopenia anemia and leukopenia her haptoglobin was low and ldh was high concerning for hemolysis dic was considered unlikely since her coagulation studies were within normal limits but doctor first name ttp hus were considered a possibility a peripheral smear showed schistocytes so the heme service was consulted however this presentation could also be secondary to a malignant hypertension inducing shearing of erythrocytes and platelets her arf could be attributed to her hypertension as well given the concern for ttp the heme service initiated plasmapheresis with the assistance of the blood bank the patient had 7 plasmapheresis treatments one of which was complicated by symptomatic hypocalcemia evidenced by abdominal pain she was plasmapheresed until her platelets reached 150 of note her adamst 13 studies were not consistent with ttp although these studies are still investigational she was also started on folate and iron for her anemia gi ms known lastname had one episode of hematemesis during plasmapheresis this was comprised of approximately 5 cc of clots of blood concurrently with a hematocrit drop with this concern for gib ms known lastname was transferred back to the micu where an egd showed diffuse linear erythema of the mucosa with no bleeding in the stomach body these findings were compatible with mild gastritis but did not account

remain on this regimen for at least 6 months and will then revisit as an outpatient the question of possible lifelong anticoagulation the patient has had extensive negative testing for hypercoagulable states including during this work up with negative anticardiolipin antiphospholipid beta 2 glycoprotein and at3 antibodies protein c and s levels were unremarkable although her clots seem to have all occured in the setting of lines her continued thrombosis is likey due to hypercoagulability from her lupus in absence of lupus anticoagulant her inr will be followed first by dr last name stitle 4883 her nephrologist and then by the coumadin clinic of company 191 it will be especially important that her coumadin be well titrated given her risk of intracranial bleed with hypertension this was communicated tothe patient and she understands and plans to be compliant with frequent blood draws for inr testing and varying her coumadin dose as directed hypertension the patient has chronically labile hypertension with frequent episodes of hypertensive urgency over systolic 200 as well as lows as far as the 80s during this admission it remains unclear why her blood pressure is so chronically labile the hope is that once she starts dialysis this will help to stabilize her blood pressure however in the interim various adjustments were made to her regimen the patient received frequent extra doses during her stay especially of hydralazine however this occasionally causes her blood pressure to swing too low to tolerate her subsequent standing dose of medication we stopped her ace and last name un as above we discharged her to home on a regimen that was reviewed with her nephrologist dr last name stitle 4883 she is discharged on clonidine patch 0 3mg qweek labetalol 900mg po tid

and the patient received morphine prn pain at her catheter site the renal team followed her closely throughout her stay she was treated for hypocalcemia as well as hyperkalemia her regimen was changed

for labile hypertension who presented to the ed complaining of about a weeks worth of right leg pain she was initially admitted to the micu for hypertensive urgency and then transfered to the floor after a day hypertensive urgency had been on labetalol drip in the ed but this was stopped due to nausea presumed that her bp was coming down too fast she was started on her home meds and tolerated these fairly well transferred to the floor and noted to have spbs in the 90s she required 1l ivf bolus since her baseline sbp is thought to run in the 130 170 range she also had transient dizziness during this episode bp meds were held and later that night her sbp was in the 220s bp meds restarted she remained stable thereafter with sbps in the 130 170s we opted to discharge her on her home regimen without decreasing doses since she is more often having issues with elevated blood pressures right leg pain no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture on plain film mri and plain films were ordered and showed no acute pathology the pain was in the distribution of her right hamstring and was worsened when it was stretched thus suggesting a muscle injury ck was normal pain was treated with
